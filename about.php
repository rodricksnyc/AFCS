                        <p class="small">In October 2010, the Air Force's Elmendorf Air Force Base and the Army's Fort Richardson combined to become one installation, in accordance with the Defense Department's 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommendations. This merger of two great installations and two powerful combat missions simply formalized an already close working relationship the Air Force and Army have shared here for years; working together under the Alaskan Command.</p>

                        <p class="small">Today, JBER continues to grow in importance to U.S. national security because of its strategic location and complementary mix of military capabilities to include F-22 Raptors, Pacific Command's only airborne brigade combat team and the C-17 Globemaster IIIs that will get them to the fight. The combination of this incredible air/ground force with world-class Alaska training facilities, such as the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex, makes JBER a jewel within the Department of Defense. The 673d ABW is composed of four groups: a mission support group, a logistic readiness group, a civil engineer group, and a medical group. The major command elements at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson are the Alaskan Command/11th Air Force; U.S. Army Alaska; the Air Force's 3rd Wing; the Alaska Army National Guard; and the Alaska Air National Guard's 176th Wing.</p>

                        <p class="small">There are nearly 50 other organizations that call JBER home. Some of those include: the 715th Air Mobility Operations Group; the 3rd Air Support Operations Squadron; the 381st Intelligence Squadron; the Air Force Reserve's 477th Fighter Group; the Canadian Forces Detachment; the U.S. Air Force Band of the Pacific; Marine Corps' Reserve training center; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; the Armed Services YMCA of Alaska; and many, many more. Work performed at Elmendorf-Richardson involves logistics, maintenance, engineering, technical, medical, finance, and other administrative and professional positions in support of the base's broad mission responsibilities.</p>

                        <p class="small">Anchorage is home to more than 40 percent of Alaska's total population. Encircled by six mountain ranges and warmed by a maritime climate, large portions of the local economy depend on Anchorage's geographical location and surrounding natural resources. The largest economic sectors include transportation, military, local and federal government, tourism, liquidations, and resource extraction. Numerous activities expose people to the immense nature and wild-life surrounding the city, from fishing and hiking to skiing and snowmobiling.</p>
                        <p class="small">Anchorage has become a sophisticated urban and cultural center with a lively festival, art, and athletic scene. Anchorage hosts the ceremonial start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Anchorage is also home to the Fur Rendezvous Open World Championship Sled Dog Races; a three-day dogsled sprint event consisting of three timed races of 25.5 miles each.

                                <p class="small">Dover is one of the fast-growing areas in the state of Delaware, due in large part to the relatively low cost of living. Dover’s largest employer is the state government, as the city hosts a large portion of the state's bureaucracy. Within the city are two institutes of higher education, Delaware State University and Wesley College. The Schwartz Center for the Arts provides a cultural base by hosting performances by the Dover Symphony Orchestra, ballet, and classic films.</p>

                                <p class="small">Two weekends a year, NASCAR stock car races are held at Dover International Speedway, attracting over 100,000 spectators and visitors, temporarily making Dover the state's largest city. These races, and in recent years adjacent slot machine gambling, contribute millions of dollars to Dover's economy. Within Dover International Speedway is Dover Downs, a harness horse racing track. Dover also hosts the Big League (Little League 16-18) Eastern Regionals, attracting teams from all of New England and the Mid-Atlantic.</p>

Residents line the narrow cobblestone streets and sit on the rooftops of their villages to watch weekly street bullfights. Dairy farming and fishing are the island's major industries, just as they were 300 years ago.</p>

                                            <h1 class="acq">Opportunities For Veterans</h1>


                                            <p class="small">AFCS is, and has always been, committed to hiring veterans. While there are Federal laws providing hiring preference and special appointing authorities for veterans, more than ever, AFCS recognizes that hiring veterans just makes sense. By actively recruiting veterans, AFCS gains the value of their experience and provides them with a means to continue their service to our country.</p>

                                            <p class="small">To meet veterans' employment information needs, the US Office of Personnel Management created a website to act as the pre-eminent source for Federal employment information for Veterans. Visit <a class="whiteStrong" href="FedsHireVets.gov" target="_blank">FedsHireVets.gov</a> for post-military career information.</p>



                                            <h1 class="acq two">Veterans’ Recruitment Appointment (VRA)</h1>

                                            <p class="small">VRA is an excepted hiring authority that allows AFCS to hire eligible veterans without competition, who meet any of the following requirements:</p>


                                            <ul class="whiteList">
                                              <li class="whiteList">Served on active duty and received a campaign badge for service during a war or in a campaign or expedition</li>
                                              <li class="whiteList">Served on active duty and received an Armed Forces Service Medal for participation in a military operation</li>
                                              <li class="whiteList">Have recently separated (within the last three years), and separate under honorable conditions (an honorable or general discharge)</li>

                                              <li class="whiteList">Are disabled</li>
                                            </ul>



                                            <p class="small">Veterans can be given an excepted service appointment under this authority at any grade level up to and including a GS-11 or equivalent. After an individual successfully completes two years of service, that individual will be converted noncompetitively to a career-conditional or career appointment in the competitive service.</p>
                                            <h1 class="acq two">Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA)</h1>


                                            <p class="small">Under the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, active duty service members are treated as veterans and given preference-eligible status (when applicable) for purposes of appointment in the competitive service for up to 120 days prior to their actual discharge/release from active duty service.</p>



                                            <p class="small">Along with the job application, a service member in this situation submits a “certification,” which is any written document from the armed forces that certifies he or she is expected to be discharged or released from active duty service in the armed forces under honorable conditions not later than 120 days after the date the certification is submitted.</p>
                                            <h1 class="acq two">30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans</h1>
                                            <p class="small">This hiring authority can be used to make appointments of eligible candidates to any position for which they are qualified, without competition. Unlike the VRA there are no grade-level limitations. Initial appointments are time-limited, lasting more than 60 days; however, the veteran can be converted to permanent status at any time during the time-limited appointment without competition.</p>



                                            <p class="small">Eligibility applies to the following categories of veterans:</p>

                                            <ul class="whiteList">
                                              <li class="whiteList">Disabled veterans who were retired from active military service with a disability rating of 30 percent or more; and</li>
                                              <li class="whiteList">Disabled veterans rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as having a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more.</li>


                                              <li class="whiteList">Are disabled</li>
